NGR is St Johns Church Garside where the observer was vicar,,,,,,,,,,
The existing church was built in 1860 on the site of a previous church.,,,,,,,,,,
There is a vicarage 200m NW but unlikely to be from the 1770s ,,,,,,,,,,
It is likely that the gauge is close to the Church,,,,,,,,,,
"There are two records that are duplicates apart from one reading, Oct 1771, which differ by only 0.01 inches",,,,,,,,,,
