MIDAS src_id 11121 LLANDOVERY P STA Start 1953 and is still current,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is a reservoir north of Llandovery adjacent to church as noted on the record. Altitudes match. Met Office location for 11121 LLANDOVERY P STA is 500m WNW with a different altitude. MIDAS start date matches; not sure if this is the predecessor to 11121 Llandovery Pumping Station but no other record fits but the gauge may have moved.,,,,,,,,,,
1956 readings have a note about wrong day and 1958 states no Sunday reading. Not sure what this means and readings left in this record,,,,,,,,,,
