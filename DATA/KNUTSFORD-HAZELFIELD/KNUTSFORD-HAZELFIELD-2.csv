"MIDAS src_id 12154 KNUTSFORD: SYCAMORES Start 1955 end 1961 but possible worng NGR, see below",,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is The Sycamores and is 100m N of Hazlefield. The NGR os the 1950s record, SJ760790, is 1.2km NNE of NGR used and altitudes do not match. Note on record and apparently in the BR reports says gauge moved from Sycamores in 1955 but a note on the 1950s record states this is not correct. Relationships to church and station are not conistent with any of the NGRs!",,,,,,,,,,
