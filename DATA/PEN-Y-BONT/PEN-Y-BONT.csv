NGR is centre of Pen-y-bont but there is no real clue as to where in the village. The relationship to the church suggests the gauge could be East of the village but it is also possible that it is the same location as the following records where the observer is J Hamer. NGR could be +/- 1km or more,,,,,,,,,,
