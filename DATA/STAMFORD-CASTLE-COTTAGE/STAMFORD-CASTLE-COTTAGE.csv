"# The observer, T.Booth, recorded rainfall at Castle Cottage, Stamford, and then at St Martin's, Stamford.",,,,,,,,
"# The directions shown on the 1880s rainfall sheet indicate the move to St Martin's happened by 1887, although",,,,,,,,
"# British Rainfall lists Booth at Castle Cottage until 1892, and at St Martin's from 1894 onwards.",,,,,,,,
# So there is some doubt about when the move happened. This file assumes the move was at the start of 1887.,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# Castle Cottage seems to be located on Sheep Market in Stamford.,,,,,,,,
