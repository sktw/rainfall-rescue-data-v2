NGR is Ryton Rectory. Altitudes match,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 1940s records has an NGR of SJ765028, which is queried by the inspector(?). The quoted altitudes, 270 ft.,are much higher than those for the rectory! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1913 Ryton Hall was used as a rectory but not sure for how long. The hall was used as a school from 1954 to 1983. The hall is close to the church and rectory and does not fit the NGR etc. on the records.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CEDA archive uses the grid reference from the records, i.e. 500 yards east of the rectory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jan 1941 estimated for snow but left in this record,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
